### Features
This was created as part of hackathon project at Ethernals - https://devfolio.co/submissions/across-wallet-24d0

The problem Across Wallet solves - 

1. We have basically built a crypto wallet with the additional functionality of being able to do cross-chain token transfers.

2. Cross-chain token transfers are an important part of the Web3 ecosystem, with so many blockchains and dapps coming up, every Dapp might use a certain specific token hence the need to transfer tokens from one chain to another has increased.

3. By default, the process of transferring tokens from one chain to another is quite complex and costly, that is why we came up with this solution.

4. We are using Biconomy's Hyphen SDK which enables quick and easy transfer with different chains, So, Our Dapp along with providing basic wallet functionalities also enables the simple cross-chain transfer of tokens.

5. In addition to this, it will let us check the complete balance, across all chains, at same place, w/o clicking to each network separately
